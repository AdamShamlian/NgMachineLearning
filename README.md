Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning Solutions 

These are my solutions to Andrew Ng's Stanford/Coursera Machine Learning class. Hopefully, 
I didn't miss anything in the conversion to Python. At some point I plan to add some of 
the more theoretical work from the [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) 
version of the course. 

If you are a current student, I encourage you to find your own solutions before consulting mine or any
others. Besides, it's possible that I have sneaky mistakes! If you see any, feel free to point them out.
